<!-- 

Here is a sales history file for a shop. 
1. I want you to create and load this into an SQL database, 
2. create an API and an interface that will give the shop owner a monthly view of ex tax sales and gross profit this year vs last year. 
3. Shop owners want to be able to easily see if they have improved or not compared to the same month in the previous year. -->
